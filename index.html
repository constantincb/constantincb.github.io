            <h1>Ciao, I'm Cristian, Constantin Cristian Buga for the friends.</h1>
            <p>I recently started my journey in the front-end development arena. From the first memories that I have there aren't
                many moments of my wake time that went by without questions and the rush to learn, that's why I came back to the 
                programming world.
